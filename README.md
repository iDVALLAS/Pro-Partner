# BrokerMatch AI — MVP

Simple dashboard that shows partnership alerts for real estate agents (WA & AZ first).

## MVP Scope
- No login.
- Dashboard-only alerts (no emails).
- Washington & Arizona agents only (starter sample data).
- No CRM export yet.

## What it does (today)
- Loads a tiny list of agents.
- Shows an alert if an agent is “hot” (ex: 3+ closings in last 90 days or a very recent closing).

## How to see the dashboard (super simple)
1. Open `docs/index.html` in this repo (after you add it below).
2. Click the **Raw** button to view it as a real web page.
3. You’ll see the alerts.

## Roadmap (short)
- Plug in real data (MODEX/public).
- Add filters (county, volume).
- Add push/email alerts.
- Add CRM export (later).
